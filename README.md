# Cypress BDD Code Sample

A sample end to end test suite to showcase my skills and methodology with end to end testing.

For demonstration purposes, I am using a clone of the Google Calculator app forked from https://github.com/warlock1996/google-calculator-clone. The version included with my submission materials contains minor modifications to fix missing selectors.

The real Google Calculator has several countermeasures in place that prevent end to end tests from working reliably.

# Setup
- Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
